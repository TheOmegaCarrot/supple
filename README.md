# cpp-utils

# What is this?

This is a small header-only library providing various handy utilities.
Some may not be handy, and may just be me having a neat idea.
Some loosely inspired by the STL, some just my ideas.

# Why is this?

I've made things I've felt might come in handy,
I've made things because I think they're neat,
I've made things just as a learning exercise.

# How do I use it?

Just copy `./inc/utils` to somewhere the compiler is
looking for includes (`-Isomewhere`) and just include what you need.
